Flashy Lights So Your Kids Don't Sneak Up And Scare You When You're At Your Desk

Imagine this… You're sitting at your desk and you are FOCUSED. You have your…   EarPods AirPods iEars AirBuds - whatever those things are called - in. Then bam! Your kids sneak up behind you and scare the crap out of you. Sucks, right?

 

Well, friendo, put a motion detector by your door and run some wires to the housing of this thing and whenever they walk in…. you get a nice calm blue light or flashy yellow lights or some lights that look like Knight Rider. And you can turn around scream at them and scare the shit out of them. HA! Now you know how it feels, kiddies.
